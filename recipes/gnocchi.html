        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious and easy tomato and gnochi bake featuring savory herbs and cheeses. Using premade gnocchi and canned tomatoes makes this meal a snap</p>
        <p>You can customize seasonings however you like to make this dish your own! I personally add extra garlic and a dash of smoked paprika(?) to add a kick.</p>
